/* TODO: Implement controller 

    This controller is supposed to be responsible to interface data coming in from the
    encode.js and decode.js files to and from the html page.
    
    Ideally, the HTML page should only call script functions from this file.
    This file will be the one to call encode.js and decode.js.
