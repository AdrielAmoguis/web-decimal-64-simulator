## Development Process

### Setting Up the Development Environment

This project is ran purely on the client-side, hence there is no need for a separate back-end server to execute the algorithms needed for this project. Hence, the files are all static, and can either be ran through the filesystem alone (by opening the HTML file in browser) or by a simple web server like XAMPP, LAMP, or even Live Server.

This development process recommends the use of Visual Studio Code's extension: Live Server. This extension auto-reloads the browser page whenever there is a file update in the directory, making the development process much more efficient. Here is the recommended setup of the development environment:

1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Install Live Server from the VSCode Extensions Marketplace
3. Clone this project
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AdrielAmoguis/web-decimal-64-simulator.git
   ```
4. Start Live Server in the project directory
5. Start developing
